Duration:  30 minutes

**[Home](../Readme.md)** - [Next Challenge Solution](./02-Create-a-custom-golden-image-solution.md)

In this exercise we will be creating an Azure Virtual Desktop host pool for personal desktops. This  hosts which operate on an as-needed basis. This personal desktop can also be used as a jump host in the following exercises.

## Task 1: Create a new Personal Host Pool and Workspace

1.  Sign in to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

2.  Search for **Azure Virtual Desktop** and select it from the list.

3.  Under Manage, select **Host pools** and select **+ Create**.

4.  On the Basics page, refer to the following screenshot to fill in the required fields. Select your Subscription, Resource Group and define a Hostpool name. As Location choose **Sweden Central **. 

> **Info:** This will only effect metadata. The Datacenter location for virtual machines will follow. 

Change **Validation environment** to **No**.

Once complete, select **Next: Virtual Machines**.

5.  On the Virtual Machines page, provision a Virtual machine with the **Windows 11 Enterprise** and follow the example values from the following screenshots.

>**Note**: The name prefix is used for the virtual machines, followed by a number, e.g. VM-T0-PERS-1, and is limited to 11 characters in this wizard.
 
For the **Image**, select **Browse all images and disks** and search to find **Windows 11 Enterprise** and select that image.

**Select your virtual network and subnet** for the network settings. You should only see one virtual network. 

For the directory option select **Microsoft Entra ID** and for the Intune question please select **No**.

Next, click **Next: Workspace**. 

6.  On the Workspace page, select **Yes** to register a new desktop app group. Select **Create new** and provide a **Workspace name**. Select **OK** and **Review + create**.

![This image shows how from the create a host pool workspace tab, enter the required information.](../Images/01-hostpoolWorkspace.png "Create a host pool workspace tab")

You can skip the "Advanced" and "Tags" tab and continue with the **Review + Create** step.

7.  Finally, select **Check + Create** and if the check was successful, click **Create**.

## Task 2: Create a friendly name for the workspace

The name of the Workspace is displayed when the user signs in. Available resources are organized by Workspace. For a better user experience, we will provide a friendly name for our new Workspace. 

>**Note**: The workspace will not appear until Task 1 has completed deployment. 

1.  Sign in to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

2.  Search for **Azure Virtual Desktop** and select it from the list.

    ![This image shows how to access Azure Virtual Desktop from the Azure portal search bar.](../Images/01-searchavd.png "Search for Azure Virtual Desktop")

3.  Under Manage, select **Workspaces**. Locate the Workspace you want to update and select the name.

    ![This image shows where to locate the workspace that was created in Task 1 and select it.](../Images/01-workspaceproperties.png "Select the workspace")

4.  Under Settings, select **Properties**.

5.  Update the **Friendly name** field to your desired name.

    ![The image shows that under properties of the workspace, you will enter a name under friendly name and save.](../Images/01-savefriendlyname.png "Enter a friendly name")

6.  Select **Save**.

## Task 3: Assign an Azure AD User to the desktop application group

In the new Azure Virtual Desktop ARM portal, we now can use Microsoft Entra ID groups to manage access to our host pools.

1.  Sign in to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

2.  Search for **Azure Virtual Desktop** and select it from the list.

3.  Under Manage, select **Application groups**.
    
4.  Locate the Application group that was created as part of Task 1 (**\<poolName\>-DAG**). Select the name to manage the Application group.

    ![This image shows where you will find the application group created in Task 1.](../Images/01-avdappgroups.png "Select the application group")

5.  Under Manage, select **Assignments** and select **+ Add**.

    ![This image shows where to find manage in the menu and select assignments and add.](../Images/01-personal-user-assignment_0.png)

6.  In the fly out, enter **Your Entra ID Group** in the search to find your Microsoft Entra ID group, e.g. **GRP-T0-Users**.

    ![In this image, you can view the groups that you need to select and save.](../Images/01-personal-user-assignment_1.png "Add Pooled Desktop user")

7.  Choose **Select** to save your changes.

    ![This image shows how to find and select the AVD Pooled desktop users in the list of users and groups.](../Images/01-personal-user-assignment_2.png "Host pool users for AVD")

With the assignment added, you can move on to the resource group and configure the RBAC permission so the selected user can access the desktop via AAD only.

1.  Go to the resource group, e.g. **RG-AVD-TEAM0** and select **Access Control (IAM)**.

    ![This image shows how to add and apply RBAC permissions to a resource group.](../Images/01-personal-user-assignment_3.png "Add Permissions")

2. Select **Add role assignment** and search for **Virtual Machine User Login** or **Virtual Machine Administator Login** to access the session with local admin rights.

     ![This image shows how to add and apply RBAC permissions to a resource group.](../Images/01-personal-user-assignment_4.png "Add Permissions")

Click **Next**.

3. Under the members tab, add your **Microsoft Entra ID Group**, e.g. **GRP-T0-Users** and apply the Role assignment. 

    ![This image shows how to add and apply RBAC permissions to a resource group.](../Images/01-personal-user-assignment_5.png "Add Permissions")

With this assignment you now can test the first connection to your AVD session host.

> **Note**: If you are trying to access your virtual desktop from Windows devices or other devices that are not connected to Azure AD, add **targetisaadjoined:i:1** as a custom RDP property to the host pool.
